    <h2>Description</h2>
    This sirloin steak recipe is served with very garlicky butter that makes this steak melt-in-your-mouth wonderful! I have never tasted any other steak that came even close to this recipe. If you are having steak, don't skimp on flavor to save a few calories.</h2>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Â½ cup of butter:</b></li>
        <li><b>4 cloves garlic, minced</b></li>
        <li><b>2 teaspoons garlic powder</b></li>
        <li><b>4 pounds beef top sirloin steaks</b></li>
        <li><b>Salt and pepper to taste</b></li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat an outdoor grill for high heat and lightly oil the grate.</li>
        <li>Melt butter in a small saucepan over medium-low heat; stir in minced garlic and garlic powder. Set aside.</li>
        <li>Season both sides of each steak with salt and pepper.</li>
        <li>Place steaks on preheated grill and cook 4 to 5 minutes per side. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read 140 degrees F (60 degrees C) for medium doneness.</li>
        <li>Transfer steaks to warmed plates; brush the tops liberally with garlic butter and allow to rest for 2 to 3 minutes before serving.</li>
    </ol>
